# CloserMetrix — Complete Platform Review

> This document catalogs every page, scorecard, chart, and table in the CloserMetrix dashboard, including the formula used to compute each metric.

---

## Architecture Overview

- **Monorepo**: Frontend (Express + Vite React) and Backend (Express + BigQuery)
- **Data Source**: Google BigQuery — primary view: `v_calls_joined_flat_prefixed`
- **Computation**: Server-side queries aggregate data, client-side `computePageData.js` handles filtering, deltas, and chart bucketing
- **Tier System**: Basic (overview only), Insight (+ financial, attendance, outcomes, sales cycle, objections, projections), Executive (+ violations, adherence)
- **Design System**: Tron dark theme with neon accent colors (cyan, green, red, amber, purple, blue, teal). Magenta exists as emergency backup only (8+ segment charts).

## Shared Formulas & Definitions

These formulas are referenced throughout all pages:

| Formula Name | Definition |
|---|---|
| Safe Divide `sd(a, b)` | Returns `a / b`, or 0 if `b` is 0 |
| Show Rate | `calls held / calls scheduled` |
| Close Rate (held-to-close) | `closed deals / calls held` |
| Scheduled-to-Close Rate | `closed deals / calls scheduled` |
| Lost Rate | `lost calls / calls held` |
| Resolution Rate | `resolved objections / total objections` |
| % Collected | `cash collected / revenue generated` |
| Delta (period-over-period) | `((current - previous) / abs(previous)) * 100` |

### Call Classification Rules

| Classification | Rule |
|---|---|
| isShow | `attendance === 'Show'` |
| isFirstCall | `callType in ['First Call', 'Rescheduled - First Call']` |
| isFollowUp | `callType in ['Follow Up', 'Rescheduled - Follow Up']` (and any other non-first-call type) |
| isClosed | `callOutcome === 'Closed - Won'` |
| isDeposit | `callOutcome === 'Deposit'` |
| isLost | `callOutcome === 'Lost'` |
| isDQ | `callOutcome in ['DQ', 'Disqualified']` |
| isNotPitched | `callOutcome === 'Not Pitched'` |
| isFollowUpOutcome | `callOutcome in ['Follow Up', 'Follow-Up']` |
| isGhost | `attendance contains 'Ghost' or 'No Show'` |
| isCanceled | `attendance contains 'Cancel'` |
| isRescheduled | `attendance contains 'Rescheduled'` |
| hasRevenue | `callOutcome in ['Closed - Won', 'Deposit']` |

## Data Pipeline Summary

1. **Calls ingested** → BigQuery `Calls` table (with `key_moments` JSON, `compliance_flags` JSON, `payment_plan_offered` STRING, and 8 score fields for AI analysis)
2. **AI pipeline** → `Backend/src/services/ai/` — PromptBuilder → Anthropic API → ResponseParser → AIProcessor → writes `compliance_flags`, `payment_plan_offered`, `intro_score`, `pain_score`, `goal_score`, `transition_score` (plus existing scores) back to Calls table
3. **Views materialized** → `v_calls_joined_flat_prefixed` (joins Calls + Closers + Clients), `v_close_cycle_stats_dated` (LEFT JOIN Closers for closer names), `v_objections_joined`, `v_calls_with_objection_counts`
4. **Server queries** → `Frontend/server/db/queries/*.js` aggregate metrics via BigQuery SQL
5. **Client computation** → `Frontend/client/src/utils/computePageData.js` handles filtering, time bucketing, deltas, and chart data shaping
6. **Rendering** → Tron-themed chart components (`TronLineChart`, `TronBarChart`, `TronPieChart`, `TronRadarChart`, `TronFunnelChart`) + `Scorecard` component with glow effects
